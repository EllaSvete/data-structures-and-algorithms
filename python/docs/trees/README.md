# Challenge

- Create a Binary Search Tree class
  - This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
  - Add
    - Arguments: value
    - Return: nothing
    - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- Contains
  - Argument: value
  - Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
