# Challenge Summary

- Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

- Time Big O(Log N): dependent on the size of the tree and grows with the space

- and Space Big O(N): tree could get very big!
