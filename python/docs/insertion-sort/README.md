# Insertion sorting blog

- The first run through of our list is already sorted, so the first element in the list is right where is should be. Great! Let's move on:

- [First Photo](first-loop.png)

- Select the next element and compare it to the previous sorted element, meaning the first element in the list:

- [Second Photo](second-photo.png)

- We will repeat this in the next two iterations because both values are greater than the previous index:

- [Third Photo](third-photo.png)
