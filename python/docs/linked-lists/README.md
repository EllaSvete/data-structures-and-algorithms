# Singly Linked List

- singly linked lists refer to the number of references the node has. There is only one reference and the reference point to the next node in a linked list.

## Challenge

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

## Approach & Efficiency

- I approached this using while loops and efficiently passing tests. I used the video as reference and worked with peers to get a couple of the tests. I then went back and commented in my code explaining each class and function ensuring I understood the logic of the day.
